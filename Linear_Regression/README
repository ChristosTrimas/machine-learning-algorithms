In this project I tried to train and test my model using linear regression. The Dataset is also provided in the files above.

The goal was to predict the grades of the students using only 5 parameters. I achieved a prediction accuracy of 85-95
approximentaly.

Using more parameters someone can achieve far more accuracy but this was only a first test in ML algorithms.
