# machine-learning-algorithms
This is a repository to try some of the known machine learning using pre made libraries of tensorflow,keras,pandas etc. Everything is written in python3 and a virtual enviroment using Anaconda was made.

---Soon I will try to implement some of the algorithms my self in Matlab or Python.
